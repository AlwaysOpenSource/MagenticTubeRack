# MagenticTubeRack
3d printable magnetic tube rack. Support for multiple sized eppendorf tubes.  
  
 ## How to use this project
Each folder will contain several files:
* Top Plate
* Middle Plate
* Bottom Plate
* Parts List  

 The plates should be printed as they are oriented in the .STL files and not assembled prior to printing.  Magnets and extra parts listed in the *PartsList.txt* will need to be purchased from elsewhere on the web (links are provided as a suggestion).  
 
 The instructions for assembly specific to each tube size are included in the *PartsList.txt* file for that tube rack.
